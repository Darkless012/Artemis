### Notes for Download

__Note on Java versions__: The previous v17.0.1 version of the Artemis software required Java version 1.8 to run. All subsequent versions from v18.0.0 onwards require a minimum of Java 9 and preferably Java 11. This must be installed first.

__Note for MacOSX__: occasionally a browser decides to display the contents of the .dmg.gz archive file rather than downloading it. If this happens hold down the <control> key and click on the download link. A popup menu should appear, containing several choices. One of the choices should be something like "Save Link As" (or perhaps "Download Link...", "Save Link to Desktop", or a variation on this theme). Select that option, and the archive file should be download correctly.

For more information about each tool, please visit their individual pages.
