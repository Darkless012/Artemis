# Overview

Artemis is a free genome browser and annotation tool that allows visualisation of sequence features, next generation data and the results of analyses within the context of the sequence, and also its six-frame translation.
Artemis is written in Java, and is available for UNIX, Macintosh and Windows systems. It can read EMBL and GENBANK database entries or sequence in FASTA, indexed FASTA or raw format. Other sequence features can be in EMBL, GENBANK or GFF format.
Full information about the latest release of Artemis can be found in the [Artemis manual](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/resources/software/artemis/artemis.pdf) and the [current release notes](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/resources/software/artemis/release_notes.txt).

# Publication

Artemis is a DNA sequence visualization and annotation tool that allows the results of any analysis or sets of analyses to be viewed in the context of the sequence and its six-frame translation. Artemis is especially useful in analysing the compact genomes of bacteria, archaea and lower eukaryotes, and will cope with sequences of any size from small genes to whole genomes. It is implemented in Java, and can be run on any suitable platform. Sequences and annotation can be read and written directly in EMBL, GenBank and GFF format.

__Notes for Download__
   
__Note for all operating systems__: The Artemis tool suite requires Java version 1.8 to run. This must be installed first.
   
__Note for MacOSX__: occasionally a browser decides to display the contents of the .dmg.gz archive file rather than downloading it. If this happens hold down the <control> key and click on the download link. A popup menu should appear, containing several choices. One of the choices should be something like "Save Link As" (or perhaps "Download Link...", "Save Link to Desktop", or a variation on this theme). Select that option, and the archive file should be download correctly.
  
__Note for Windows__: you may need to shift-click on this link to download the file. Also please ensure that after downloading this file is called "act.jar" with no other hidden extensions. Some windows systems change the name so it looks like a zip file, if this happens then do not unzip it just rename it to "act.jar".
