# The Artemis Software
## A set of software tools for genome browsing and annotation

## Overview
The Artemis Software is a set of software tools for genome browsing and annotation. It includes:

* [Artemis](Artemis/)
* [Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT)](ACT/)
* [BamView](BamView/)
* [DNAPlotter](DNAPlotter)

## Software Availability
The Artemis Software is available under GPL3. The source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Artemis).

The latest release of Artemis can be downloaded by clicking on the relevant link below:

* [UNIX](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Artemis/releases/download/v18.0.2/artemis-unix-release-18.0.2.tar.gz)
* [MacOS](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Artemis/releases/download/v18.0.2/artemis-macosx-release-18.0.2.dmg.gz)
* [MacOS (CHADO) - for out of the box CHADO database connectivity](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Artemis/releases/download/v18.0.2/artemis-macosx-chado-release-18.0.2.dmg.gz)
* [Windows](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Artemis/releases/download/v18.0.2/artemis-windows-release-18.0.2.zip)

Or via [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io). Simply use:
```
conda install artemis -c bioconda
```
from the command line, and you're ready to go (no Java installation required).

For older versions of the Artemis software please see the [Artemis FTP site](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/resources/software/artemis/)

For further instructions please select the relevant application link at the top of this page or view our [GitHub page](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Artemis/).

### Notes for Download

__Note on Java versions__: The old v17.0.1 version of the Artemis software required Java version 1.8 to run. All subsequent versions from v18.0.0 onwards require a minimum of Java 9 and preferably Java 11. This must be installed first. A Java installation is not required for the Bioconda route.

__Note for MacOSX__: occasionally a browser decides to display the contents of the .dmg.gz archive file rather than downloading it. If this happens hold down the <control> key and click on the download link. A popup menu should appear, containing several choices. One of the choices should be something like "Save Link As" (or perhaps "Download Link...", "Save Link to Desktop", or a variation on this theme). Select that option, and the archive file should be download correctly.

For more information about each tool, please visit their individual pages.

## Documentation

Specific information is provided on the individual application pages (see [overview](#overview) section above). Application manuals can be found here:

* Artemis manual - [online](https://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Artemis/Artemis/artemis-manual.html) or [PDF](https://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Artemis/Artemis/artemis-manual.pdf).

* ACT manual - [online](https://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Artemis/ACT/act-manual.html) or [PDF](https://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Artemis/ACT/act-manual.pdf).

The GitHub project [README](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Artemis/blob/master/README.md) also has some useful information.
