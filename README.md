### Notes for Download

__Note for all operating systems__: The Artemis tool suite requires Java version 1.8 to run. This must be installed first.
   
__Note for MacOSX__: occasionally a browser decides to display the contents of the .dmg.gz archive file rather than downloading it. If this happens hold down the <control> key and click on the download link. A popup menu should appear, containing several choices. One of the choices should be something like "Save Link As" (or perhaps "Download Link...", "Save Link to Desktop", or a variation on this theme). Select that option, and the archive file should be download correctly.
  
__Note for Windows__: you may need to shift-click on this link to download the file. Also please ensure that after downloading this file is called "act.jar" with no other hidden extensions. Some windows systems change the name so it looks like a zip file, if this happens then do not unzip it just rename it to "act.jar".
