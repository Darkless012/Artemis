This plugin uses the Java implementation of the SSH version 2
protocol from:

http://freshmeat.net/projects/sshtools-j2ssh/

Currently the following jars are needed to be put into this 
directory:

commons-logging.jar
j2ssh-core.jar
jce-jdk13-119.jar
xercesImpl.jar

(which are incorporated or can be built from the j2ssh download)
