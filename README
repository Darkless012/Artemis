INTRODUCTION

Artemis is a DNA sequence viewer and annotation tool that allows visualisation
of sequence features and the results of analyses within the context of the
sequence, and its six-frame translation.  Artemis is written in Java, reads
EMBL or GENBANK format sequences and feature tables, and can work on sequences
of any size.

ACT is a DNA sequence comparison viewer based on Artemis. The name ACT stands
for Artemis Comparison Tool. ACT is written in Java, reads EMBL or GENBANK 
format sequences and feature tables, and can work on sequences of any size.
