# DNAPlotter
DNAPlotter can be used to generate images of circular and linear DNA maps to display regions and features of interest. The images can be inserted into a document or printed out directly. As this uses [Artemis](/Artemis/Artemis/) it can read in the common file formats EMBL, GenBank and GFF3.

## Citation
> DNAPlotter is an interactive Java application for generating circular and linear representations of genomes. Making use of the Artemis libraries to provide a user-friendly method of loading in sequence files (EMBL, GenBank, GFF) as well as data from relational databases, it filters features of interest to display on separate user-definable tracks. It can be used to produce publication quality images for papers or web pages.
