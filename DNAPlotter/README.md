# DNAPlotter
DNAPlotter can be used to generate images of circular and linear DNA maps to display regions and features of interest. The images can be inserted into a document or printed out directly. As this uses [Artemis](/Artemis/Artemis/) it can read in the common file formats EMBL, GenBank and GFF3.

## Citation
> DNAPlotter is an interactive Java application for generating circular and linear representations of genomes. Making use of the Artemis libraries to provide a user-friendly method of loading in sequence files (EMBL, GenBank, GFF) as well as data from relational databases, it filters features of interest to display on separate user-definable tracks. It can be used to produce publication quality images for papers or web pages.

### Notes for Download

__Note for UNIX/Windows operating systems__: The Artemis tool suite requires Java version 1.8 to run. This must be installed first.

__Note for MacOSX__: occasionally a browser decides to display the contents of the .dmg.gz archive file rather than downloading it. If this happens hold down the <control> key and click on the download link. A popup menu should appear, containing several choices. One of the choices should be something like "Save Link As" (or perhaps "Download Link...", "Save Link to Desktop", or a variation on this theme). Select that option, and the archive file should be download correctly.

## Installation 
For installation instructions please see the [Artemis manual](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/resources/software/artemis/artemis.pdf).

## Usage
For instructions please see the [Artemis manual](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/resources/software/artemis/artemis.pdf)

## Contact
For issues encountered with installing the software please contact your local system administrator. For all other issues, please report them to our [Github issues page](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Artemis/issues) or email <artemis-help@sanger.ac.uk>.
