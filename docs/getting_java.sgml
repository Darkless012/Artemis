Macintosh users with MacOS version 8 or 9 should install the <ULINK
URL="http://developer.apple.com/java/text/download.html">Macintosh Runtime
for Java (MRJ)</ULINK> version 2.2 or better before downloading &prog;.
Macintosh users with MacOS X (ie MacOS version 10) or better do not need to
install Java because it comes as a standard feature of the operating system.
Note, however, that Java on the older versions of MacOS X has has irritating
bugs so we recommend using the latest version of MacOS, which runs &prog; well.
