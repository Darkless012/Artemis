    <PARA>
  &prog; is a DNA sequence viewer and annotation tool that allows visualisation
of sequence features and the results of analyses within the context of the
sequence, and its six-frame translation.  &prog; is written in Java, reads
EMBL or GENBANK format sequences and feature tables, and can work on sequences
of any size.
    </PARA>

    <PARA>
On Unix and GNU/Linux systems, given an EMBL accession number &prog; also can
read an entry directly from the
<ULINK URL="http://www.ebi.ac.uk" TYPE="external">EBI</ULINK> using <ULINK
URL="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch" TYPE="external">Dbfetch</ULINK>.  This
feature is still experimental, but copes well with straightforward entries
(see <XREF LINKEND="LAUNCH-WINDOW-FILE-MENU-READ-FROM-EBI">).

      <PARA>
On Windows systems with Java (version 1.3 or higher), installing &prog; 
is as simple as downloading the the artemis.jar file to an appropriate 
place (such as the desktop or the Programs folder). When downloading
some versions of windows mistake this file for a zip file ensure it
does not name this artemis.zip, if it does rename it to artemis.jar 
(DO NOT UNZIP THIS FILE).
