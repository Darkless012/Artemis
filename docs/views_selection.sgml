      <PARA>
To select a feature just click on it with the first mouse
button.  This will unselect anything that is currently selected.  To add a
feature to the selection rather than replacing the current selection, hold the
<LITERAL>shift</LITERAL> key while clicking.   A single feature can be removed
from the selection in the same way, because shift-clicking acts as a toggle.
The situation is made slightly more complicated by the existence of spliced
genes.  When a feature segment (exon) is added to the selection the feature
that contains the segment is implicitly added as well.  When the last segment
of a feature is removed from the selection, the feature is implicitly removed.

A single base or amino acid can be selected simply by clicking on it.  A range
of bases can be added by clicking on the base at one end of the range then
shift-click on the base at the other end of the range.  Alternatively you can
drag out a range of bases: click on a base then hold the mouse button down and
move to the other end.  To select a complete open reading frame (ORF), double
click the middle mouse button (see <XREF LINKEND="MOUSEBUTTONS">) anywhere
inside the ORF (see <XREF LINKEND="SELECTMENU-ORF"> for another way to
select an ORF).
