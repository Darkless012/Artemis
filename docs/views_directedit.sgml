The direct editing option (See <XREF
LINKEND="LAUNCH-WINDOW-OPTIONS-DIRECT-EDIT">) enables the user to change the
start or end position of a segment by dragging it around with the mouse.  This
works best in the DNA view window.  As an example, to move the start position,
click the mouse button on the first base of the feature or exon, hold the
button down, move the mouse pointer to the desired position, then release the
button.
