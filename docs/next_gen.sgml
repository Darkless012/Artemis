    <TITLE>Read BAM / VCF ...</TITLE>
     <PARA>
Read a BAM file that has been sorted and indexed using <ULINK
URL="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/">samtools</ULINK>. This provides an integrated
<ULINK URL="http://bamview.sourceforge.net/">BamView</ULINK> panel displaying
sequence alignment mappings to a reference sequence. This require Artemis to
be run with Java 1.6 as it makes use of <ULINK URL="http://picard.sourceforge.net/">
picard</ULINK> to read from the BAM file.

Variant Call Format (<ULINK
URL="http://1000genomes.org/wiki/doku.php?id=1000_genomes:analysis:vcf4.0">VCF</ULINK>)
files can also be read. The VCF files need to be compressed and indexed using bgzip and
tabix respectively (see the <ULINK URL="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/tabix.shtml">tabix manual</ULINK> and
<ULINK URL="http://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/">download page</ULINK>).
The compressed file gets read in (e.g. file.vcf.gz) and below are the commands for
generating this from a VCF file:
        </PARA>
        <SYNOPSIS>
        bgzip file.vcf
        tabix -p vcf file.vcf.gz
        </SYNOPSIS>
      <PARA>
Alternatively a Binary VCF (<ULINK URL="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/mpileup.shtml">BCF</ULINK>) can
be indexed with BCFtools and read into Artemis or ACT.
      </PARA>
        <PARA>
As with reading in multiple BAM files, it is possible to read a number of (compressed and indexed)
VCF files by listing their full paths in a single file. They then get displayed in separate rows
in the VCF panel.

        <PARA>
For single base changes the colour represents the base it is being changed to, i.e. T black,
G blue, A green, C red. There are options available to filter the display by the different
types of variants. Right clicking on the VCF panel will display a pop-up menu in which
there is a 'Filter...' menu. This opens a window with check boxes for a number of varaint types and properties that can
be used to filter on. This can be used to show and hide synonymous, non-synonymous, deletion (grey),
insertion (yellow), and multiple allele (orange line with a circle at the top)
variants.  In this window there is a check box to hide the variants that do not overlap CDS features.
There is an option to mark variants that introduce stop codons (into the CDS
features) with a circle in the middle of the line that represents the variant. There are also options
to filter the variants by various properties such as their quality score (QUAL) or their depth across the
samples (DP).
        </PARA>
        <PARA>
Placing the mouse over a vertical line shows an overview  of the variation as a
tooltip. Also right clicking over a line then gives an extra option in the pop-up
menu to show the details for that variation in a separate window. There are also
alternative colouring schemes. It is possible to colour the variants by whether they are
synonymous or non-synonymous or by their quality score (the lower the quality the
more faded the variant appears).
