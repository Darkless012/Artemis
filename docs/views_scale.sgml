      <TITLE>Changing The Scale</TITLE>
      <PARA>
The vertical scrollbar at the right edge of the view controls the scale -
moving the scrollbar up will zoom in and moving the scrollbar down will zoom
out.  When the scrollbar is at the top (at it's most "zoomed-in" position),
the complete six frame translation is shown.  Otherwise only the stop codons
are shown.  
<![ %artemis-only; [
The main difference between the overview and the DNA view is that
the DNA view initially shows the full translation, whereas the overview shows
only the stop codons.  The other difference is that the labels are on in the
overview by default (see <XREF LINKEND="VIEWS-POPUPMENU">).
