&prog; will run on any machine that has a recent version of Java.
This version of &prog; requires Java 1.6 at least. Most of the
development has been done using JDK v1.6 and some of the more 
advanced features (BamView and VCF/BCF View) require 1.6. 
Please note that the version of Java that comes with Netscape and
Internet Explorer is not sufficient to run &prog;.  See <XREF
LINKEND="INSTALLATION"> for details on how to get Java.
