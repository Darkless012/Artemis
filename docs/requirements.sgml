&prog; will run on any machine that has a recent version of Java.
This version of &prog; requires Java 1.5 at least. Most of the
development has been done using JDK v1.6 and some of the more 
advanced features (BamView) now require 1.6. 
Please note that the version of Java that comes with Netscape and
Internet Explorer is not sufficient to run &prog;.  See <XREF
LINKEND="INSTALLATION"> for details on how to get Java.
