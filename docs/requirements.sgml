&prog; will run on any machine that has a recent version of Java.  Most of the
development has been done using JDK v1.1.7 and v1.1.8, but any version better
than v1.1.1 is sufficient for running &prog; on UNIX.  (Early versions of v1.1
have some bugs, so later is better.)  Version 1.2 or better is needed on
Windows.  Please note that the version of Java that comes with Netscape and
Internet Explorer is not sufficient to run &prog;.  See <XREF
LINKEND="INSTALLATION"> for details on how to get Java.
