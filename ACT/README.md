# Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT)
ACT is a Java application for displaying pairwise comparisons between two or more DNA sequences. It can be used to identify and analyse regions of similarity and difference between genomes and to explore conservation of synteny, in the context of the entire sequences and their annotation. It can read complete EMBL, GENBANK and GFF entries or sequences in FASTA or raw format.

### Related Software
Two separate ACT-related web applications have been developed.
   
* [WebACT](http://www.webact.org/WebACT/home) was developed at Imperial College, and allows users to generate comparisons from their sequence files or use a set of pre-computed comparisons. All comparison files can be downloaded for local use or launched in ACT.
* [DoubleACT](http://www.hpa-bioinfotools.org.uk/pise/double_actv2.html) was developed by Anthony Underwood and Jonathan Green at the [Public Public Health England](http://www.hpa.org.uk/) and allows you to paste or upload sequences to generate ACT comparison files.

## Publication
> The Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) allows an interactive visualisation of comparisons between complete genome sequences and associated annotations. The comparison data can be generated with several different programs; BLASTN, TBLASTX or Mummer comparisons between genomic DNA sequences, or orthologue tables generated by reciprocal FASTA comparison between protein sets. It is possible to identify regions of similarity, insertions and rearrangements at any level from the whole genome to base-pair differences. ACT uses Artemis components to display the sequences and so inherits powerful searching and analysis tools. ACT is part of the Artemis distribution and is similarly open source, written in Java and can run on any Java enabled platform, including UNIX, Macintosh and Windows.
