Version x

	Added option to "Create features from graph peaks". For a graph 
	this creates features in regions above a given cut-off and above 
	a given feature size.
	
Version 10

	Add redo function to 'Edit' menu. Also enable/disable undo and
	redo menu items when available/not available.
	
	Add option to replace selected bases in 'Edit' menu.
	
	Option to create features in intergenic regions added.

	Feature editor now marks hyperlinks to SWALL, EMBL, UniProt, 
	PMID, PubMed, InterPro, OrthoMCLDB, Pfam that are opened in 
	the browser. Now configured in the options file.
	
	Added "Convert Qualifier of Selected..." option to the Edit menu.
	This allows the user to change the names of qualifiers for all
	selected features.
	
	Now using new release of j2ssh (0.2.9). This requires Jav1.5+.

	Implemented option for ORF creation to take into account boundaries
	of multiple fasta sequences, so that they do not cross them.

	Implemented the ability to run and store fasta and blast search 
	results for multiple databases... E.g. fasta searches on uniprot 
	and on user's own database, stored in multiple fasta_file qualifiers.

 	"Set Score Cutoffs" in Artemis popup menu uses existing /scores as
 	the initial min and max values (rather than just 0 and 100).

	Added cache to store the entries retrieved for the object editor.
	
	Implement log4j logging to be displayed in log viewer. Using colour
	coding depending on level of logging.
	
	Added -Doffset so that Artemis can be opened at a given base.

Version 9

	Feature selector can be used to look for features with introns 
	that do no contain the GT/GC start or AG end.

	Contig tool now checks for contigs that contain features that
	span the boundaries of the contigs. These features have to be 
	removed or restricted to the contig boundary before it can 
	carry out contig reordering.

	Fix for converting files from other file formats to
	genbank format.

	Fix rounding problem for long sequences when writting 
	out all bases in FASTA or raw format.

	Cache the start codons (as per stop codon caching),
	to speed their display.

	Combine the extend to next exon and the fix stop codons
  	into one option.

	The feature types that appear on the frame lines can be defined
	by the user via an option ("Frame Line Features...") in the 
	feature display popup menu.
	
	Added to File -> Preferences a user defined selection for display names
	and systematic names. Also extended popup menu option in feature lists 
	to allow the user to be able to select multiple qualifiers to display.

	For entries opened from the remote side of an SSH connection will search
	for results on the remote file system if they are not found locally. They
	are transferred via SSH and then stored locally.

	For Mac users, the option to send search results to the browser will
	display the results in the default browser.

	When automatically generating gene names (under the Edit menu), the user
	can specify the number of zeros to pad the numbering with. e.g if 5 digits are
	selected the format will look like : 00001, 00002 etc.
