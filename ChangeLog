	Feature selector can be used to look for features with introns 
	that do no contain the GT/GC start or AG end.

	Contig tool now checks for contigs that contain features that
	span the boundaries of the contigs. These features have to be 
	removed or restricted to the contig boundary before it can 
	carry out contig reordering.

	Fix for converting files from other file formats to
	genbank format.

	Fix rounding problem for long sequences when writting 
	out all bases in FASTA or raw format.

	Cache the start codons (as per stop codon caching),
	to speed their display.

	Combine the extend to next exon and the fix stop codons
  	into one option.

	The feature types that appear on the frame lines can be defined
	by the user via an option ("Frame Line Features...") in the 
	feature display popup menu.
